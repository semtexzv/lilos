/// A [counting semaphore].
///
/// A `Semaphore` gets initialized with a certain number of _permits._
/// Callers can take one permit from the semaphore using the
/// [`Semaphore::acquire`] operation, which will block if there are none
/// available, and wake when one becomes available.
///
/// Permits can be added back to the semaphore one at a time using the
/// [`Semaphore::release`] operation, or in batches using
/// [`Semaphore::release_multiple`].
///
/// Semaphores are useful for restricting concurrent access to something,
/// particularly in cases where you don't want to restrict it to exactly one
/// observer (like with a `Mutex`). Two common use cases are:
///
/// - To ensure that no more than `N` tasks can make it into a critical section
/// simultaneously, you'd create a `Semaphore` with `N` permits. Each task would
/// `acquire` a permit to gain entry, and then `release` it at the end. In this
/// case, a "permit object" might be fine, because `acquire` and `release` are
/// both being called in the same context.
///
/// - To represent data being generated or received (perhaps over a network),
/// you'd create a `Semaphore` with 0 permits. Tasks interested in consuming
/// resources would attempt to `acquire` and block; as data becomes available,
/// the generating task would `release` permits, potentially in batches, to
/// unblock the consumers. In this case, `release` and `acquire` are happening
/// in totally different contexts.
///
/// To support _both_ these uses, the `Semaphore` API is different from a lot of
/// Rust concurrency APIs, and does not return a "permit object" that represents
/// a permit until dropped. If your use case is closer to the first example, and
/// you would like the convenience of a permit object managing calls to
/// `release` for you, have a look at [`ScopedSemaphore`], a thin wrapper that
/// provides a [`Permit`].
///
///
/// # Getting a semaphore
///
/// Like `lilos`'s `Mutex` type, `Semaphore` must be pinned to be useful. So
/// generally you'll wind up writing something like this:
///
/// ```
/// let scooters = pin!(Semaphore::new(5));
/// // Drop &mut:
/// let scooters = scooters.into_ref();
///
/// // Check out one scooter from the pool.
/// scooters.acquire().await;
/// ```
///
/// This crate includes a convenience macro, [`create_semaphore!`], that
/// basically just wraps up the first two lines:
///
/// ```
/// lilos_semaphore::create_semaphore!(scooters, 5);
///
/// // Check out one scooter from the pool.
/// scooters.acquire().await;
/// ```
///
///
/// # Fairness
///
/// This semaphore implementation is _fair,_ which in this context means
/// that permits are handed out in the order they're requested. If the
/// semaphore runs out of permits, tasks requesting permits are queued in
/// order and will be issued permits in order as they are returned to the
/// semaphore.
