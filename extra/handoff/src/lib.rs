//! Mechanism for handing data from one task to another, minimizing copies.
//!
//! This crate provides the `Handoff` abstraction for `lilos`.
//!
//! There are two sides to a `Handoff<T>`, the sender and the receiver. When both
//! the sender and receiver are ready, a single `T` gets transferred from the
//! sender's ownership to the receiver's. In this case, "ready" means that
//! either the sender or receiver was already blocked waiting for its peer when
//! that peer arrived -- with both tasks waiting at the handoff, we can copy the
//! data and then unblock both.
//!
//! Because we don't need any sort of holding area for a copy of the `T`, a
//! `Handoff<T>` is very small -- about the size of two pointers.
//!
//! In computer science this is referred to as a _rendezvous_, but that's harder
//! to spell than handoff.
//!
//! # Creating and using a `Handoff`
//!
//! Because the `Handoff` itself contains no storage, they're cheap to create on
//! the stack. You then need to `split` then into their `Pusher` and `Popper`
//! ends -- these both _borrow_ the `Handoff`, so you need to keep it around.
//! You can then hand the ends off to other futures. A typical use case looks
//! like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut handoff = Handoff::new();
//! let (push, pop) = handoff.split();
//! join!(data_producer(push), data_consumer(pop));
//! ```
//!
//! If you just want to synchronize two tasks at a rendezvous point, and don't
//! need to move data, use `Handoff<()>`. It does the right thing.
//!
//! # Caveats and alternatives
//!
//! Only one `Pusher` and `Popper` can exist at a time -- the compiler ensures
//! this.  This simplifies the implementation quite a bit, but it means that if
//! you want a multi-party rendezvous this isn't the right tool.
//!
//! If you would like to be able to push data and go on about your business
//! without waiting for it to be popped, you want a queue, not a handoff. See
//! the `lilos::spsc` module.
//!
//! Note that none of these types are `Send` or `Sync` -- they are very much not
//! thread safe, so they can be freely used across `async` tasks but cannot be
//! shared with an interrupt handler. For the same reason, you probably don't
//! want to attempt to store one in a `static` -- you will succeed with enough
//! `unsafe`, but the result will not be useful! The queues provided in `spsc`
//! do not have this limitation, at the cost of being more work to set up.
//!
//! # Cancel safety
//!
//! `Handoff` is not strictly cancel-safe, unlike most of `lilos`. Concretely,
//! dropping a `push` or `pop` future before it resolves can cause the loss of
//! at most one data item.
//!
//! While technically cancel-unsafe, this is usually okay given the way handoffs
//! are used in practice. Please read the docs for [`Pusher::push`] and
//! [`Popper::pop`] carefully or you risk losing data.
//!
//! If the push and pop ends of the handoff are "long-lived," held by tasks that
//! won't be cancelled (such as top-level tasks in `lilos`) and never used in
//! contexts where the future might be cancelled (such as `with_timeout`), then
//! you don't need to worry about that. This is not a property you can check
//! with the compiler, though, so again -- be careful.
