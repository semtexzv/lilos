//! A simple mechanism for sharing a piece of data and being notified if it
//! changes.
//!
//! This module provides [`Watch<T>`], a data structure that lets you share some
//! data of type `T`, update it from multiple producers, and efficiently notify
//! multiple consumers when it changes.
//!
//! A `Watch<T>` is particularly useful for things like configuration data,
//! which are effectively "global" (shared by many tasks) but may need special
//! handling of changes.
//!
//! ```
//! let shared_number = Watch::new(1234_u32);
//! ```
//!
//! You can create a _receive handle_ to the `Watch<T>` by calling
//! [`subscribe`][Watch::subscribe]. This produces a [`Receiver<T>`] that allows
//! its holder to inspect the shared data, and be notified when it changes.
//!
//! ```
//! let rcvr = shared_number.subscribe();
//! // A receiver only tracks changes made _after_ it's created:
//! assert_eq!(rcvr.is_changed(), false);
//! ```
//!
//! You can create a _send handle_ to the `Watch<T>` by calling
//! [`sender`][Watch::sender]. This produces a [`Sender<T>`] that allows its
//! holder to update the shared data.
//!
//! ```
//! let sender = shared_number.sender();
//!
//! // Update the shared data:
//! sender.send(4567);
//!
//! // Now the receiver sees a change:
//! assert_eq!(rcvr.is_changed(), true);
//!
//! // We can inspect it and mark it as seen:
//! rcvr.glimpse_and_update(|value| assert_eq!(*value, 4567));
//! ```
//!
//! Code that wants to monitor changes to the data can use the
//! [`Receiver::changed`] future to do so:
//!
//! ```
//! loop {
//!     rcvr.changed().await;
//!     rcvr.glimpse_and_update(|value| process(value));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Reentrancy and panics
//!
//! It is possible to attempt to use handles for a single `Watch<T>` reentrantly
//! if you try hard enough. The implementation checks for this and will panic.
//! For instance, attempting to send a new value from _inside_ the closure
//! passed to [`Receiver::glimpse`]:
//!
//! ```
//! let shared = Watch::new(some_data);
//! let sender = shared.sender();
//! let rcvr = shared.subscribe();
//!
//! // This line will panic at runtime.
//! rcvr.glimpse(|contents| sender.send(*contents));
//! ```
//!
//! It is perfectly safe to send or inspect a _different_ `Watch<T>` instance
//! from within one of these closures, just not the same one.
//!
//! In practice it's pretty hard to do this accidentally, but, now you know.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! Specifically, the `Watch<T>` contains a _change count_. Each time its
//! contents are updated by any `Sender`, the change count gets incremented.
//!
//! Each `Receiver` has its own copy of the change count, reflecting what the
//! count was at the last time that `Receiver` accessed the shared data. If the
//! change count stored in the `Watch` is different from the one stored in the
//! `Receiver`, then there is an update that hasn't been seen by its holder yet.
//!
//! Because the `Watch<T>` only stores a single copy of the data and a counter,
//! a `Receiver` may not see _every_ update to the data. If multiple updates
//! happen between checks, the `Receiver` will only ever see the last one. This
//! keeps both the storage requirements, and the cost of updates, low.
//!
//! `Watch<T>` contains a [`Notify`] internally, which it uses to efficiently
//! wake tasks that are awaiting [`Receiver::changed`].
